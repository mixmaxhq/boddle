## How to Open a Ticket

- Before you open a ticket or send a pull request,
  [search](https://github.com/mixmaxhq/neckbone/issues) for previous discussions
  about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

- Before sending a pull request for a feature or bug fix, be sure to have
  [tests](http://backbonejs.org/test/).

- Use the same coding style as the rest of the
  [codebase](https://github.com/mixmaxhq/neckbone/tree/master).

- All pull requests should be made to the `master` branch.
